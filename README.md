# CODE GENERATOR APP

This app takes hexadecimal code of a color as input from the user. Then, it will show the different shades of the color, half of them are lighter and half of them are darker.
User can copy the hexadecimal code of any of the shades of the color simply by clicking on the box representing the shade of color.

In this App, I learnt about a new library called 'values.js' and how to use it for the generation of the hexadecimal code of the colors.
